### Task Week  2 - bank.py

#### Description 

<details>
    <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>When Banks are storing currency figures, they store them as integers (usually in cent).This is to avoid rounding errors. 
>
>Write a program called bank.py 
>
>The program should:
>Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
>Add the two amounts
>Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 
>

```sh
$ python bank.py
Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180
The sum of these is â‚¬2.45

```
</p>
</details>

This program is designed to ask the user for two monetary quantities in cents and then calculate the total amount in euros. The resulting amount is displayed with the Euro sign symbol.

- - - -

#### How it works

Here the main steps of the program:

- The program can be run by executing the "bank.py" script. 
- The program will prompt the user to enter a first quantity in cents.
- A  second quantity in cents will be asked to the user.
- The program will them calculate the total amount in Euro by adding the two quantities and dividing the result by 100.
- The total amount in Euro will be displayed with the Euro Symbol

           <p>

The user is asked for two quantities in cents. The quantities need to be integer (absolute number).
```python
cents1 = int(input("Please enter an amount (in cents): "))
cents2 = int(input("Please enter an amount (in cents): "))
```
The program calculate the total amount in Euro by adding user inputs (cent1 and cent2) and dividing them by 100.
```python
amount_in_euro = (cents1 + cents2)/100

```
Print the total amount in Euro with the [Euro symbol](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39935857/how-can-i-print-a-euro-%E2%82%AC-symbol-in-python#:~:text=Euro%20is%20encoded%20as%2080h%20%280x80%29%20in%20the,as%20others%20said%2C%20using%20the%20correct%20encoding%20%28utf-8%29%3A).

### Task Week 3 - account.py 

#### Description 

<details>
    <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).
>
>Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).


```sh
$ python accounts.py
Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
XXXXXX7890
```
> Extra:
>
>Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)
</p>
</details>

I decide to develop the program following the "extra" request.

This program is designed to ask the user for an account number and print the account number with all the digits replaced with X's except for the last 4 digits. 
It can handle account numbers of any length, but the number of digits replaced with X's will vary depending on the length of the account number.

- - - -

#### How it works

Here the main steps of the program:
- The program can be run by executing the "account.py" script
- The user will be asked to enter an account number 
- The program will then calculate the length of the account number and get the last 4 digits
- It will calculate the number of X's that are needed to replace the remaining digits
- It will then display the masked account with all the digits replaced by X's except the last 4 digits 

<details>
           <summary>Code comments</summary>
           <p>

Get the user to enter an account number of any length
```python
account_number_input = input("Please enter an account number: ")
```
The length of the account number input by the user is calculated
```python
account_lenght = len(account_number_input)
```
Obtain the last 4 digits of the account number
````python
account_last_4_digits = account_number_input[-4:]
````
Calculate the number of X's needed to masks all but the last 4 digits with X's. 
````python
number_of_X = account_lenght - 4
````
Print the masked account.
````python
print("X"*(number_of_X)+account_last_4_digits)                    
````

### Task Week 4 - collatz.py

#### Description 

This script prompt the user to enter a positive number and, depending on whether the number is even or odd, perform a calculation until the number is 1. The program will either divide the number by 2 (if it is even) or multiply it by 3 and add 1 (if it is odd). Each new number will be added to a list, and the full list will be printed out when the loop is exited.

<details>
    <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.
Push the program in your pands-problem-sheet GitHub repository (like you do for all the weekly tasks).
Example of it running:
>

```sh
$ python collatz.py

Please enter a positive integer: 10

10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```
</p>
</details>

- - - -


#### How it works

Here the main steps of the program:
1. The script first prompts the user to enter a positive number. A first while loop is used to check if the user enters a positive number. If they do, the script exits the first while loop, If the user enters a negative number, the script will continue to prompt the user to enter a positive number until one is provided.
2. The script will check whether the number is even or odd and cased on that perform a calculation.
   -  If the number is even, the script divides it by 2 and adds it to the "numbers" list. 
   - If it is odd, the script multiplies the number by 3, adds 1, and then adds it to the "numbers" list. 
3. The while loop will continue until the number is one.
4. When the number is 1 the while loop will exit and the full list will be printed 

<details>
           <summary>Code comments</summary>
           <p>

Create an empty list to store the generated sequence of numbers
```python
numbers = []
```
Prompt the user to enter a positive number which is then converted in an integer and stored in the number variable.
```python
number = int(input("Please Enter a positive number: "))
```
A first while loop is used to ensure that the user enters a positive number If the number entered is less than or equal to 0, the loop will execute and prompt the user to enter a positive number again.
````python
while number <=0:
    print("You didn't enter a positive number!")
    number = int(input("Please Enter a positive number: "))
````
A second while loop is executed until the number 1 is reached.

````python
while number != 1:
````
If the number is [even](https://www.toppr.com/guides/python-guide/examples/python-examples/python-program-to-check-if-a-number-is-odd-or-even/.), it is divided by 2 and the result is stored in the number variable. 
````python
    if (number%2) == 0:
        number = int((number / 2))                     
````
If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, and it in the "number" variable.
````python
    else:
        number = int((number * 3 + 1))                 
````
Append the new number to the "numbers" list.
````python
    numbers.append(number)             
````
Print with a for loop the sequence of numbers generated by the calculation.
````python
for n in numbers:
    print(n, end= " ")            
````

### Task Week 5 - weekday.py

#### Description 
The Weekday Checker is a Python program that checks whether today is a weekday or the weekend, and prints a message indicating which one it is. The program uses the datetime module to get the current day of the week, and the termcolor module to print colored text to the console. When run, the program prints the message "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday." in red if today is a weekday, or "It is the weekend, yay!" in red if today is the weekend.

<details>
    <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. (The program should be called weekday.py)
>An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.

```sh
$ python weekday.py
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
```
>An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:

```sh
$ python weekday.py
It is the weekend, yay!
```
</p>
</details>

- - - -


#### How it works

Here the main steps of the program:

1. Import the datetime module and the termcolor module
2. Use the datetime.datetime.today() function to get the current date and time
3. Use the weekday() function to get the current day of the week, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.
4. Check whether the current day of the week is less than 5 using an if statement.
5. If the current day of the week is less than 5, print the message "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday." in red 
6. If the current day of the week is 5 or 6 (i.e., the weekend), print the message "It is the weekend, yay!" in red.

<details>
           <summary>Code comments</summary>
           <p>

Import datatime for working with data and time.
```python
import datetime
```
Import termocolor-cprint from printing colored text.
```python
from termcolor import cprint
```
Determine the [current day of the week](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29384696/how-to-find-current-day-is-weekday-or-weekends-in-python). This code used the **'today()'** method of the **'datatime()'** class to get the current date and time, and the **'weekday()** method to extract the of the week as an integer. 0-5 is Monday-Friday (week days) and 5-6 are Saturday-Sunday (weekend days).
````python
weekno = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()
````
This code print the appropriate message based on the day of the week. The if statement check whether **'weekno'** is less than 5, which means it is a weekday (Monday-friday). the script prints the message **"Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday."** in red color using the [cprint](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-colors-python-terminal/) function. Otherwise, if **'weekno'** is 5 or 6, the script prints the message **"It is the weekend, yay!"** in red color using cprint.

### Task Week  6 - Squareroot

#### Description 

<details>
           <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.

```sh
$ python squareroot.py
Please enter a positive number: 14.5
The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.
```
</p>
</details>

In addiction to the requested task, The program is first checking that the user enter a positive number. If the number negative the program will propose several scenario until the number input by the user will be positive.

In summary, the program prompts the user to enter a positive floating-point number, and then calculates the square root of that number using the Newton method. If the user enters a negative number, the program calls a function called choice_user() to handle the case and prompt the user to either keep the same number and make it positive, or enter a new positive number. The program then calls the sqrt() function to calculate the square root of the input number using the Newton method, and prints the result.

#### How it work

Here the main steps of the program:

1. Prompt the user to enter a positive floating-point number.
2. Define a function called choice_user() to handle the case where the input number is negative.
3. Define a function called sqrt() to calculate the square root of a number using the Newton method.
4. If the input number is negative, call choice_user() to prompt the user to either keep the same number and make it positive, or enter a new positive number.
5. Call sqrt() function to calculate the square root of the input number using the Newton method.
6. Print the result of the square root calculation.

<details>
           <summary>Code comments</summary>
           <p>

Prompt the user to input a positive-floating number and assign the input value to the 'user_input' variables. 
If the user does not enter a positive number, prompt a message with 2 options and ask the user to enter their choice."

```python
user_input=float(input("Please enter a positive float number "))
```
Define a function called choice_user(). The function is called when the input number is not positive.
```python
def choice_user():
        print("You didn't enter a postive numer")
        print("\t Select what do you want to do: ")
        print("\t\t(a) keep the same number but make it positive")
        print("\t\t(b) enter a new number")
        choice = input("Enter your choice : ")
```
If the user choose option "a", make the number positive and return it.

```python
if choice == "a":
            new_number = abs(user_input)
            print (f"The new number is {new_number}")
            return new_number] 
```
If the user choose option "b", prompt the user to enter a new positive number

```python
else:
            return float(input("Please enter a positive float number "))
````

Define a function called sqrt(). This function calculate the square root of a number using the Newton-Raphson method:
- The initial guess is set to half of the user input.
- A better approximation is calculated using the formula: better = 0.5 * (approx + user_input/approx)
- A loop is run until the better approximation is equal to the previous approximation
- Finally, the final aproximation is returned (the square root)

```python
def sqrt(user_input):
    approx = 0.5 * user_input
    better = 0.5 * (approx + user_input/approx)
    while better != approx:
        approx = better
        better = 0.5 * (approx + user_input/approx)
    return approx
```
This is the main program where each function is recalled if needed.
As long us 'user_input' is less than 0 the 'choice_user()' function will run. The output will be a positive 'user_input' float number that will enter in the sqrt() function that will be passes into the sqrt() function to calculate its square root.Finally, the square root will be printed with a round of 4 digits.


```python
while user_input < 0:
    user_input = choice_user()
    
square_root = sqrt(user_input)
print(round(square_root,4))
```

### Task Week 7 - ES

#### Description 

<details>
    <summary>Task requested:</summary>
           <p>

>Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. 
>The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. 

```sh
$ python es.py moby-dick.txt
116960
```
</p>
</details>

- - - -
The program read a file text called by the user through the prom command and return the number of time the letter "e" is in the file.
For my understanding from the explanation of the exercise the program should be called es.py and the file moby-dict.txt.
As an addiction functionality I have made the program tell to the user, in case the file doesn't exist, that the file have not been found in the directory and to create it or check the spelling.

#### How it works

The program prompts the user to input the name of a text file to be read using the sys module. The program then checks if the file exists in the current directory. If the file does not exist, the program informs the user that the file does not exist and either needs to be created or the file name needs to be checked. In this case, to meet the task requirements, a file named "moby-dick.txt" has been created in the same directory to be read by the program if specified by the user. If the program finds the file, it opens the file in read mode and counts the number of occurrences of lowercase "e" only. Finally, the program prints the count of the lowercase "e" occurrences in the file.

<details>
           <summary>Code comments</summary>

```
Get the filename from the user through a command line argument 

```python
filename = sys.argv[1] 
```
Establish the variable "letter" as the letter that will be counted.
````python
letter = "e"
````
Funciont that:
   1. open the file in read mode 
   2. read file contents into variable
   3. count the occurence in the the file of the variable letter
   4. return this count
